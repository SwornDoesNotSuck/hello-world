# hello-world
A repository that I pour some random ideas and stuff.
HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLO People that are readng this README file. I think no one ever reads README files. But hey, here you are and while you are here, here is an about me section.
I am sworn and I like Coding and playing games. I currently am learning javascript and C#. I already know HTML5 and CSS3. I mainly want to learn javascript and c# because I want to add javascript to my webpages that I sometimes randomly make and C# because I want to learn unity and use UNITYS PARTICLE SYSTEM.And thats all. Might add more to this later.Seeya!
